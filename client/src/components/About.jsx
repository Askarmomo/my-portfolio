                    Hello! I’m Askar, a passionate <span className=" font-semibold text-slate-300">Full-Stack Developer</span> with <span className=" font-semibold text-slate-300">1 year of hands-on experience</span> building robust and scalable web applications.  My journey in web development began on December 28, 2023 <span className=" font-semibold text-slate-300">i spend minimum 4 hour in a day for my development journey</span>. Initially, I had no prior exposure to IT, and I didn’t have strong beliefs in my abilities. However, through dedication and hard work, I’ve grown into a confident and skilled full-stack developer, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

                    I specialize in developing dynamic and user-friendly applications using the <span className="text-slate-300 font-semibold"> MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)</span>. I’m constantly exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront of innovation. From crafting intuitive front-end designs to architecting efficient back-end systems, I take pride in delivering seamless and impactful user experiences.

                    What truly excites me about this field is its endless possibilities for creativity and problem-solving. I love turning ideas into functional, beautiful, and scalable digital products that can make a real difference in people’s lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring <span className=" text-slate-300 font-semibold">Forex Trading</span>, or brainstorming ideas for my next entrepreneurial venture.
